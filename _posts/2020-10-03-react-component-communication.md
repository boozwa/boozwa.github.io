Really good site that  explains how react components communicate with one another with out using
flux. Think of it as Vanilla React code. 

Parent to child
* props
* Instance Methods

Child to Parent
* Callback Functions
* Event Bubbling

Sibling to Sibling
* Parent Component

Any to Any
* Observer Pattern
* Global Variables
* Context

See [This Link][this-link] for the full breakdown.
