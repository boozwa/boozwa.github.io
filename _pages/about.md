Jake Pichel is an experienced controls engineer in the manufacturing industry. A Californian native from Temecula who has lived in several regions throughout the state, he received his Mechanical engineering undergraduate degree from San Jose State University. He moved on to work in Santa Maria for five years as a controls engineer at North American Fire Hose Corporation.

He is a father of one (so far), loves golf and backpacking. When time allows, he creates indie games and short films, is a casual gamer at night, and once upon a time, a badass drummer in a screamo band.

He is now a business owner and an aspiring software developer, mostly self-taught through Udemy Bootcamp courses. He is actively looking to expand his network to see if his skills can help others achieve their goals. Feel free to contact him via email or Linkedin to chat!

Cheers!
